# My Portfolio Website
This is my first serious portfolio website. I have just made simple html portfolios before and this time i will take it a step longer. 
I will try to use TailwindCSS in this project because i really like the style you are writing it in. 

In this README.md i also learnt some markdown language that i have not used before!

> #### Files and folders used to configure and use TailwindCSS:
